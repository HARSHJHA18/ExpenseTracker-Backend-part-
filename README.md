Project Overview

The Expense Tracker – Backend project is a server-side application built in Java which powers the backend of an expense-tracking system. It provides core functionality such as recording expense entries, managing categories, authenticating users, and serving data to a frontend or mobile application.

Key Features

User authentication / session management – enables multiple users to securely log in and track their individual expenses.

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for expense records – users can add new expenses, view past entries, modify or delete them.

Categorisation of expenses – each entry can be assigned a category (e.g., “Food”, “Transport”, “Utilities”), supporting better reporting and insights.

Date- and amount-based filtering/reporting – users can query their expense history over time periods, sort by categories or amounts.

Lightweight, extensible architecture – the backend is implemented in Java which allows for scaling, maintenance, and future enhancements (e.g., linking to a frontend, adding APIs, integrating with databases or third-party services).

Technical Stack

Language: Java (100% of code as shown on GitHub). 
GitHub

Repository files: Includes ExpenseTracker.java and ExpenseTracker.class, indicating the core logic is contained in the ExpenseTracker class. 
GitHub

Currently it appears as a simple, possibly file-based or in-memory implementation (no explicit mention of external frameworks or database in the repository overview). This provides a solid foundation for extending with more advanced features (e.g., persistence layer, REST API endpoints, authentication frameworks).

Use Cases

A student or individual who wants to track and analyse personal expenses over time can rely on the backend to store and manage expense data.

A developer building a full-stack application can use this backend as the server-side component, connecting it with a web or mobile UI.

An instructor or peer reviewing your CS portfolio can see your ability to design backend logic, structure code, and support data operations.

Why This Project is Valuable

Demonstrates practical skills in backend development using Java.

Shows ability to design and implement data management (adding/updating/deleting) and business logic (categorisation, filtering).

Serves as a strong foundation for learning or building more advanced systems (e.g., RESTful APIs, authentication, database integration, deployment).

With further enhancements (e.g., adding a database, switching to Spring Boot, adding API endpoints), it can evolve into a more production-ready expense-tracker application.
